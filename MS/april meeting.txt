Meeting outline:
Explain basic methods
Show species level and individual level dataframes
Bipartite vs one-mode
Network level descriptors vs species level
One-mode measures of centrality


Next steps:
Make decisions about what we are interested in
-one mode are cool - social network 
Functional groups

Q - 
multivariate to multivariate?
Richness
Beta diversity measures
Ca/cca/da
Ordination data at the alpha level

Assessment of similarity 
Phylogenetic distance between shrubs & cacts

Functional grp vs RTU
How to do null network comparisons - observed to null -> calculate effect size as difference from random?
Null model that is spatially explicit?

Influence metrics 
Robustness of networks -effect size comparisons
What is the most useful thing for others from all these metrics?
Modularity using functional groups
Modularity of one-mode
